### Project description
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts

### What case are we solving?
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 1 to 100 and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant "write a program that guesses a number"
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than the one we need.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**
Learning to write good Python code
