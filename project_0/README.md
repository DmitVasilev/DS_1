### Project description
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts

### What case are we solving?
You need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 1 to 100 and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant "write a program that guesses a number"
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than the one we need.

**Quality metric**   
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**   
Learning to write good Python code.

### Stages of the project
- The "predict_number" function was written to guess the number in less than 20 attempts: [game_v2.py](https://github.com/Tio147/DS_1/blob/main/project_0/game_v2.py) 
- Checked with the help of the previously written "score_game" function, how many attempts are guessed on average out of 1000 cases: [game_v2.py](https://github.com/Tio147/DS_1/blob/main/project_0/game_v2.py)
- A test function "test_game" has been written that checks how many attempts it takes to guess each number and determines the maximum number of attempts: [test.py](https://github.com/Tio147/DS_1/blob/main/project_0/test.py)
- Created requirements.txt file to ensure code reproducibility: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Tio147/DS_1/blob/main/project_0/requirements.txt)

### Results
The written function guesses the number in 5 attempts on average, the maximum number of guessing attempts is 7: [game.ipynb](https://github.com/Tio147/DS_1/blob/main/project_0/game.ipynb)

### Conclusions
Learned the basics of working with VS Code, GitHub, Jupiter Notebook, Google Colab.
